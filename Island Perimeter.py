# You are given a map in form of a two-dimensional integer grid where 1 represents land and 0 represents water.
# Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally). The grid is completely surrounded by water,
# and there is exactly one island (i.e., one or more connected land cells). The island doesn't have "lakes" (water'\
#    ' inside that isn't connected to the water around the island). One cell is a square with side length 1.
# The grid is rectangular, width and height don't exceed 100. Determine the perimeter of the island.
